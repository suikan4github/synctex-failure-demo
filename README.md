# SyncTeX-failure-demo
Demonstration of the SyncTex failure on TeX Live 2024

# Details
This is a demonstration of SyncTeX failure of TeX Live 2024. 

With this small document, you can see the chapter 2 "Fox" is unable to link with LaTeX source for both forward and backward. 

This problem was found when I switched from pLaTeX to LuaLaTeX. The original problem was found in a large document bigger than 100pages. 

This demonstration is shrank from that document.

# Consideration 
This problem seems to be a problem of LuaLaTeX or SyncTeX rather than viewer, because both LaTeX workshop and TeX works can reproduce in different OS environment.
